Once upon a Tuesday, which was pretending to be a Friday, there lived a slightly confused sandwich.#! 
It dreamt not of mustard nor of ham, but of existential questions and occasional marmalade.#! 
Its only friend was a teaspoon named Barry.#! 
Barry had seen things.#! 
Mostly teaspoons.#! 
Together, they ventured nowhere in particular.#! 
And that, dear reader, was quite enough.#!

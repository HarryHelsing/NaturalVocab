# NaturalVocab
A language app designed to explore and learn words in an
interesting and personal way.
Upload text you're interested in and study words in context.
Designed to work through the natural method of language
learning.

This app is all about personalising your language learning
journey. Since the text you upload is personal to your
interests and you are the one guiding your and evaluating
your learning process this means you can find your own
rhythm, rather than adhering to someone else's process.

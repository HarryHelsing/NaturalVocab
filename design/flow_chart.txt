You upload content which you find
interesting and engaging, so that
you learn the words in context,
in a way that you personally
connect with.

More than this, though the app
primarily tracks the amount of
words you've become comfortable
with, it is deisgned in such a
way that over time the grammar
of the language in naturally
aquired.

The app is made to be structured,
without being inflexible. It
